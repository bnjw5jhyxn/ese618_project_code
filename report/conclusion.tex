\section{Conclusion}

I tried to improve estimates of the Markov parameters $G$
of a stable linear system
by adding a regularization term $\Verts{\mathcal{H}(G)}$
to the optimization objective.
This approach failed to give improved performance
compared with least squares
and was much more computationally expensive.

I also compared simple averaging to ordinary least squares
and explained why they have the same performance
on marginally stable systems.
