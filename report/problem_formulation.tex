\section{Problem Formulation}

We focus on the system identification problem
described by \cite{oymak2019singletraj}.
Consider a linear system with
state space $\Real^n$ where $n$ is unknown,
input space $\Real^p$,
and observation space $\Real^m$,
and dynamics
\begin{align*}
x_{t+1} &= A x_t + B u_t + w_t \\
y_t &= C x_t + D u_t + z_t \\
w_t &\sim \mathcal N (0, \sigma_w I_n) \\
z_t &\sim \mathcal N (0, \sigma_z I_m)
\end{align*}
where the system parameters $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$
are matrices with the appropriate dimensions
and the $w_t$ and $z_t$ are independent.
Suppose we want to learn the system parameters
(up to a similarity transform)
by running a single-trajectory experiment.
